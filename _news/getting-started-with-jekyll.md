Jekyll is great. It just hit 3.0 and it has come a long way from the 'simple, blog-aware, static site generator' it started out as. [Collections](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) brings support for custom content types beyond pages and posts. Sass and CoffeScript compiling are now handled by default. It's a great time to be building websites with Jekyll.

You can have a look at the official [documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) to get up to speed on the specifics of how things work. If you get stuck there is an [official forum](https://talk.jekyllrb.com) where you can get some help. And there is also a #jekyll room on chat.freenode.net where you'll find lots of helpful developers hanging out and willing to answer a question or two.
