### Basically:

* **[Sign up](https://manage.siteleaf.com/signup)** for a free account.
* **Create a Github repo** with [this](https://github.com/BryanSchuetz/siteleaf-jekyll) or some other valid Jekyll project.
* **In Siteleaf, connect your Github repository**. You don't have to sync with Github in order to use Siteleaf but if you plan to make any kind of changes to theme files, or work on content locally, it's the best way.
* **Publish**. One of the great things about Siteleaf is that you can publish wherever you wantâ€”Github, Amazon S3, Rackspace, FTP/SFTP, etc. And now in V2 not only is the static output of the site portable, but since it's just a Jekyll project, all of the site code is too. You can push it to Github and have them build the site. You can sync to your local repository and build locally if you want, it's up to you.
